# Autogram
Autogram is an AppleScript application that automates the selection, captioning, and posting of photos to Instagram. It relies on an imperfect machine vision service trained on a proprietary (and unknown) corpus of photos that results in [inexplicable curatorial decisions and, often, unintentional hilarity](https://www.instagram.com/jasoneppink/).

Autogram requires [cliclick](https://www.bluem.net/en/projects/cliclick/) and has only been tested on Mac OS 10.9.5 with AppleScript 2.3.2 using Chrome 67.0.3396.87, iPhoto 9.5.1, and Safari 9.1.3.
